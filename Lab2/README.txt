I use a Windows operating system. First, download the zip file and find where it is located on your computer. Then compile it using the 
javac command like PS C:\Users\16159\IdeaProjects\Lab2\src\edu\baylor\ecs\csi3471\HasslerHarrison\module1> javac. Then go to the 
specific java file in module1 that you want to run and use the java command in the terminal to run it. This example was used in the
terminal inside InteliJ. PS C:\Users\16159\IdeaProjects\Lab2\src\edu\baylor\ecs\csi3471\HasslerHarrison\module1> java StringExercise1.java Hello.
